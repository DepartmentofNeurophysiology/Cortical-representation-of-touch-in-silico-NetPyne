# Cortical-representation-of-touch-in-silico (NetPyNE version)

Biologically inspired, computationally efficient network model of the somatosensory cortex after reconstructing the mouse barrel cortex in soma resolution and defining a mathematical model of cortical neurons whose action potential threshold adapts to the rate of ongoing network activity impinging onto the postsynaptic neuron.

This is a NetPyNE implementation, the original model, written in Matlab, can be found [here](https://github.com/DepartmentofNeurophysiology/Cortical-representation-of-touch-in-silico).

A detailed explanation of the NetPyNE implementation can be found [in the folder "Documentation"](https://github.com/DepartmentofNeurophysiology/Cortical-representation-of-touch-in-silico-NetPyne/blob/main/Documentation/Cortical%20representation%20of%20touch%20in%20silico.docx).
